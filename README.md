What is the project about?
GRC is BEP-20 cryptocurrency that is backed by gold. It has 10% buy and 12% sell taxes. 3/4% is used for automatic BUSD rewards to holders. 2/3% is used for automatic liquidity. 3% used for marketing (developer's wallet). 2% is transferred to another developer's wallet (gold wallet), which is used for purchasing gold. There is no tax on transactions between wallets. 

What makes your project unique?
The project is unique as the developer uses part of the tax to purchase and store gold at Melbourne Mint. The price of gold is relatively stable. That gold will be used in the future to exchange GRC for gold. It can also be used by a developer during a bull market to buy back GRC and stabilize the price of GRC. This is done to provide more security for GRC holders. 

History of your project.
The developer always believed in gold-backed currencies and was disappointed about the current situation in the world, where the government can print fiat currency without any gold-backing. The developer wanted to create a cryptocurrency that is not just numbers on the screen, but that these numbers are tied to valuable physical asset - gold. 

Whatâ€™s next for your project?
The plan is to widely spread the awareness of GRC and allow people to purchase the currency that is backed by gold. The plan is to list GRC on major exchanges. Holders should be able to exchange GRC for gold in the future. 

What can your token be used for?
The token is used as a source of passive income through BUSD rewards. It is used as a more stable and secure investment. In the future, the plan is to reduce the tax to just gold tax (2%) and make GRC usable for purchases in stores.
